# Resistor

## Gameplay

Resistor top-down dungeon crawler game where every time you shoot, you lose health.

## My Role

In this group project I was in charge of designing the enemies.

### Welder

The welder is a melee enemy that attacks when it gets within range of the player.

### Security Bot

The security bot is a ranged enemy that fires once the player is within range of the enemy. It used to move counter clockwise around the player, but was changed to stand still to make it easier to kill.

### Bomber

The bomber is a enemy that self-destructs once it gets close to the player and does massive amounts of damage when it gets close. It will also explode if the player kills it.

### The Boss

The boss moves in a set path and has two stages to him. In stage one it has 2 welder enemies attached to it that need to be killed in order for the boss to be damaged. AFter getting the boss low enough, the welders are replaced with security bots. The boss has 2 different attacks and randomly chosses which attack it's going to use. Its first attack shoots out bullets all around it at random speeds. The second attack tracks and charges up a laser for about a second and strikes where the player was last tracked to be.
