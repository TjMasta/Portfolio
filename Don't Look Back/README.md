# Don't Look Back

## Gameplay

The game is a 2D side scrolling game where your main objective to go through a house and find a key to unlock the door to get out. At the same time, you're trying to not get caught by the monster that lurks inside.

## My Role

One of my job was to program and animate the door to be opened and closed by the player and the enemy. I was also tasked with designing the layout and decorating the rooms in the levels, except for the first one. Looking over everything and fixing any bugs I could before deadlines were due was another I did constantly.
