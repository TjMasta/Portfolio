# Secret Game

## Gameplay

The player is give a small amount of time to escape the boat they're on. They pick up clues, tools, and a cypher to get the code that lets them off the ship and get to safety.

## My Role

I was tasked with making the inventory, designing two of the puzzle based minigames, one gives the cypher, the other may give a clue. I also made the keypad that takes in the player input and checks if the right code was put in.

## Game Jam

This was made for a Game Jam where we were given the topic of secret at 5pm on a Friday and was given until 11pm on Saturday to design and create a game. Our team's game was awarded best overall at the award's ceremony.
