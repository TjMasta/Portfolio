# Project: Asteroids

## Description
A recreation of the old school classic game of Asteroids in unity.

## User Functionality
When you start up the game, there will be a text prompt saying that 
you can press any key to start or 'G' for arcade mode. From there you will be able to move with the arrow keys and fire with space bar. 

## Other Features
If you press 'G' before the start of the game you will get 3 abilities to use once per wave of asteroids. 'Z' will hit every asteroid once, killing it or breaking it into 2 smaller asteroids. 'X' will freeze the asteroids for about 2 seconds. 'C' will let you be invulnerable for about 2 seconds.

## Caveats
Asteroids will sometimes spawn on top of the player during new rounds. This is combated by giving the player a new life at the start of a new wave.
