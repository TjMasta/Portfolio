I choose to make my web app a Brewery finder. You enter you city, state, and what kind you and you get results back based on what you put. You can search for just the city, state, or just by type, but putting nothing in any of the fields doesnâ€™t output anything. The city is a search bar, the state selector is a drop down menu with the state abbreviations, and the brewery types are radio buttons. The search bar remembers the last thing the user searched for and has the default value of Rochester if the user has never been on the site. The css and JavaScript are in seperate files.
